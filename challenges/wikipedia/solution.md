# [Wikipedia](https://ctflearn.com/challenge/168) (30)
A strange problem, tried pinging the ip, visiting it in the browser, googling it etc. <br />
The solution is to go the wikipedia and simply search for the ip. <br />
<br />
![IP search](img/search_ip.png)
This will search for all user contributions from the IP 128.125.52.138, the one from 17 August 2015 is relevant.<br />
<br />
![Contributions](img/contributions.png)
Viewing the [diff](https://https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Flag&diff=prev&oldid=676540540) of the contribution we find the flag. <br />
