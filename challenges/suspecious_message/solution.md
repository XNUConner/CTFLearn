# [Suspecious message](https://ctflearn.com/challenge/887) (30)
The first clue is in the challenge message: <br />
> My friend Fari <br />

*Fari* is actually an anagram of fair, if we google *fari cipher* all results revolve around the [Playfair Cipher](httos://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playfair_cipher) <br />
Upon downloading the [image](https://ctflearn.com/challenge/download/887) we are presented with a cipher table: <br />
![cipher table](img/photo.png) <br />

We can use this key table to decrypt the ciphertext <br />
1. The ciphertext is `MQDzqdor{Ix4Oa41W_1F_B00h_m1YlqPpPP}` <br />
2. The key is `QWERTYUIOPASDFGHKLZXCVBNM` (note the J is not present)<br />
3. From the format of the ciphertext, we can assume it begins with `CTFlearn{` <br />
4. Following the rules denoted in the [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playfair_cipher), we can decipher our message:  <br />
Our flag is: `CTFlearn{Pl4Yf41R_1S_C00l_c1PheRrRR}` <br />

*A playfair cipher key table is generated by writing the cipher key but as we continue to write, ignoring any repeating characters in the key*
